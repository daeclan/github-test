Why Young Thug is the Best Rapper Alive
By Declan Murphy

Young Thug rocks. He is cool as heck.
He rhymes in ways that make your favorite
rapper look like a piece of paper and by
that I mean two dimensional and basic. He
elevates every idea that crosses his drug
addled mind with an artistic touch available
only to the geniuses of our world.

Thanks again for reading !
